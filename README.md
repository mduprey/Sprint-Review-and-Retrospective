The Product Owner will meet with the End User and develope user stories based on their needs. This helps the creation of a product backlog and from there each item can be put in priority order based on the customer's request.The prduct backlog will then be implemented in the scrum backlog by the development team.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approace developing programs in a very organizational manner. I like to have code that is easy to read and can be followed by even someone completely new to reading code. I also like to have continued communication with my team which makes the agile method a great match for me.  I like the idea of flexibility and being able to return to past work when necessary if changes have been made to requests, rather than going through the whole process over and over again when there is change.
